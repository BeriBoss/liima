AMW
-------------------------
Version Updates are done with the maven release plugin. If you experience any issues, please see the instructions in https://twiki.puzzle.ch/bin/view/Puzzle/MavenArtifactory

mvn release:prepare

- choose the version number of the new release as well as the following version number when asked. Please make sure, that the following version number is postfixed with "SNAPSHOT". 
IMPORTANT: Since this project lives in the same repository as the AMW main application, please make sure, that you indicate "shakedown" in your tag names. This makes it easier to separate and thee release plugin will fail if you use the same tag twice...

mvn release:perform

- this checks out the new version, builds it and copies the deployables to the artifactory


You also can rollback your release-step with

mvn release:rollback
