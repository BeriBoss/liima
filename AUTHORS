AMW was originally created by Puzzle ITC between 2011 and 2016 as a project for Die Mobiliar.

We then together decided that the knowhow and expertise formed within the project team and the software itself
could probably be useful for other engineers, operation teams, devs and the community, that it's worth to make 
AMW open source.

We decided to define the next steps and legal aspects in a binding contract between Die Mobiliar and Puzzle ITC, which
basically gave us the legal power to make AMW open source under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added features and generally made AMW that much better:

	Lorenz Beyeler
	Reto Galante
	Christoph Gutmann 
	Robin Lack
	Andreas Maierhofer
	Yves Peter
	Thomas Philipona
	Antonio Romano
	Oliver Schmid
	Beat Schwaller
	Daniel Tschan
	Claudia Weber
	Michael Zaugg

	
A big THANK goes to:

	Die Mobiliar for letting us open-source AMW
